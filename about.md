I'm a PhD student in Harvard University's Department of Government, studying campaigns and 
participation in American politics. Previously, I was a researcher with the Center for Responsive
Politics focusing on PACs and outside spending. I occasionally write about campaign finance, transparency, civic engagement,
and the ethics of activism for Boston Review. I also enjoy adding to my data skills in R and SQL, 
especially when I can apply them to advanced baseball and basketball statistics. In my free time,
I read, root for the Red Sox and University of Wisconsin basketball, and play blues piano.

This site is mostly a way for me to fool around with GitHub, Python, and HTML to practice what I've
learned. And to improve my SEO vis-a-vis the guy in Germany who shares my name.
