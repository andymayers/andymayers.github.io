I'm a researcher with the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/">Center for Responsive Politics</a>,
focusing on political action committees, outside spending, and campaign expenditures. In addition to 
writing for CRP's blog, I occasionally write about campaign finance, transparency, civic engagement,
and the ethics of activism for Boston Review.

This site is mostly a way for me to fool around with GitHub, Python, and HTML to practice what I've
learned. I also enjoy adding to my data skills in R and SQL.
