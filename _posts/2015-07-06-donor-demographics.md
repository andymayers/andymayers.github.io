I co-wrote a series of posts for the OpenSecrets blog about the demographics of 2014's
top 500 campaign donors. No surprises here: the biggest donors are 
[old](http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2015/06/donor-demographics-old-white-guys-edition-part-i/),
[white](http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2015/06/donor-demographics-old-white-guys-edition-part-iii/),
and [male](http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2015/06/donor-demographics-old-white-guys-edition-part-ii/).
Some of my favorite findings:

-- The average Republican mega-donor was 66.7 years old in 2014...but the average Democratic
mega-donor wasn't exactly youthful at 64.1.
-- Women accounted for just 8.2% of the money donated by the top 500, people of color less
than 1%.
-- There are probably not more than 12 people of color among the top 500, only one of whom
is Black and one Hispanic.
-- My back-of-the-envelope calculation based on surnames: Hispanics made around 2% of all
campaign contributions in 2014.

I'd love to replicate this research with help from someone who knows more about name classification
and/or matching with other datasets.
