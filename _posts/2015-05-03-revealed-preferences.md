I've made a conscious effort to listen to more new music over the last year or two
in an effort to stave off the inevitable moment when pop culture passes me by. Ever 
since I realized that I tend not to absorb an album by listening to it passively while
working, I've made sure to rate them on RateYourMusic.com so I can at least retain my
impressions. My top five albums released since 2013:

4.5 Stars:

- Foxygen, _We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic_
- Courtney Barnett, _Sometimes I Sit and Think, Sometimes I Just Sit_
- Kate Tempest, _Everybody Down_

4 Stars:

- Punch Brothers, _The Phosphorescent Blues_
- Joe Henry, _Invisible Hour_
- Todd Terje, _It's Album Time_
- Vampire Weekend, _Modern Vampires of the City_
- Julia Holter, _Loud City Song_
- Elivs Costello and The Roots, _Wise Up Ghost_
- Sharon Jones and The Dap Kings, _Give the People What They Want_

If I were ordering these retrospectively, I'd put Vampire Weekend on top ("Hudson" was
easily my favorite song of 2013), followed by Courtney Barnett. But these were my 
impressions at the time.
