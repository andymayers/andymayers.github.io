title: Review of "Smart Citizens, Smarter State"
---

I've [written a review](http://bostonreview.net/blog/andrew-mayersohn-beth-simone-noveck-smart-citizens-smarter-state)
 of Beth Simone Noveck's _Smart Citizens, Smarter State_ for _Boston Review_.
It's a vision of smarter government through crowd-sourcing and soliciting outside expertise and,
just as importantly, an argument that providing expertise and solving problems is a form of civic engagement.
That description might sound a little techno-utopian, but the best thing about the book is that it's
realistic about the obstacles for its agenda and what that agenda could possibly achieve.

The book does have some weaknesses that I couldn't get into in the review. For example, it could 
stand to be a little less credulous about some of the crowd-sourcing examples it cites, or
discuss the ways in which communities of experts can be systematically biased. But it would
definitely be unfair to lump Noveck with futurists who don't examine power dynamics when
proposing to apply technology to public policy. Anyway, it's been a while since I've read a book
that made me genuinely excited about a reform agenda.
