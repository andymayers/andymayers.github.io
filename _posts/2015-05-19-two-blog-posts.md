title: Two New Blog Posts
---

I've written two new pieces for the OpenSecrets blog, one about 
[how members of different occupations have different political habits](http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2015/05/campaign-donor-is-not-a-job-but-occupation-can-predict-party-preference/),
even within the same industry, and another about 
[candidates that were suspiciously dependent on contributions from out-of-state destinations](http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2015/05/candidates-on-the-fly-travel-far-and-wide-for-donations/).
With many months to go before we see any meaningful 2016 campaign finance numbers, we have to come up
with ever more creative ways to analyze 2014 data.
